## **Homework Assignments**

Throughout the course, students will complete several homework assignments aimed at reinforcing the concepts covered in lectures and reading materials (See the [homework page](https://ta-sbu.github.io//assignments/), which will be updated during the course). The due dates for these assignments will be posted on this website.

Please follow the instructions to turn in your homework:
- Homeworks must be submitted electronically as PDF files.
- Files should be named according to the following scheme:
   - HW<2-digits homework number>\_\<LastName>\_\<FirstName>.pdf.
   - For instance, my first homework would be called HW01_Vazan_Milad.pdf.
- Email your homework to **vazan.sbu@gmail.com**

## **Exams**

The course will include **two exams**. Both exams will assess the required readings and topics covered in class. The first exam will be an "in-class" [midterm](https://ta-sbu.github.io//exams/midterm), while the second will be a [final exam](https://ta-sbu.github.io//exams/final) scheduled during the University's final examination period at the end of the semester.

**If you need to miss the midterm test due to illness or a family affliction, please contact me by email. A make-up exam for the midterm might be organized.**

## **Seeking Assistance**

Here are the available help resources, organized by the urgency of your issue:

### **Messaging**
Our course will utilize a Telegram group (link to be provided in class) as the primary communication platform for announcements and discussions. This is an ideal space for asking questions that can be answered by anyone. It's best to use this resource for non-urgent inquiries.

### **Talk with the Instructor**
For any issues at all, please reach out to the instructor:

- Speak with me before class  
- Raise your hand or speak up during class


## **Collaboration Policy**

You are encouraged to discuss the content of this course with anyone you like; however, it is essential to **maintain academic integrity** in your work. All homework assignments, projects, and exams must be completed independently, meaning you are not permitted to copy any part of another student’s solution, collaborate with others on your assignments, or use solutions from unauthorized sources, including the Internet. **Therefore, the solution you submit for each assignment must be solely your own, reflecting your understanding and effort.**

## **Generative AI Usage Guidelines**

You are encouraged to use Generative AI tools like ChatGPT for general coding-related queries. **However, refrain from asking these tools to directly solve problems from the course problem sets.** 

## **Textbooks/Materials**
**My lecture notes are sufficient for students to successfully pass the examination.**
{: 	.text-red-300 }
There is no single textbook for this class. Instead, the material will be drawn from various texts and sources.

[Lecture notes](https://ta-sbu.github.io//Notes/), [homework assignments](https://ta-sbu.github.io//assignments/) and their solutions, and other supplementary materials will be made available on this website throughout the course. 





## **A note on self care.** 
Please take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
